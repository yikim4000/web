<h2>PHP<h2>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP" target="_blank">
PHP</a> is a general-purpose scripting language geared toward web development.[7]
It was originally created by Danish-Canadian programmer Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994.[8]
The PHP reference implementation is now produced by The PHP Group.[9]
PHP originally stood for Personal Home Page,[8] but it now stands for
the recursive initialism PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor.[10]

PHP code is usually processed on a web server by a PHP interpreter implemented
as a module, a daemon or as a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) executable.
On a web server, the result of the interpreted and executed PHP code –
which may be any type of data, such as generated HTML or binary image data –
would form the whole or part of an HTTP response. Various web template systems,
web content management systems, and web frameworks exist which can be employed
PHP can be used for many programming tasks outside the web context,
such as standalone graphical applications[11] and robotic drone control.[12]
PHP code can also be directly executed from the command line.</p>
